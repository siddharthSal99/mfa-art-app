# Random MET Learning App
## The app in a nutshell:
This app will query the MET api and provide information about paintings in different ways
### Page 1: random art
This page will generate an info display of a random piece of art based on "department" and optional "start date" and "end date"
### Page 2: 
###
## Hooks and their functionality:
### useEffect
we will use the useEffect hook to make the API call to the MET back
### useState
useState will be used to save individual state for the various components of the app
### useRef
maybe we can use useRef to update the image of the current painting
### useMemo
maybe we can use useMemo to save the state of the app if we want to search for the same thing multiple times?
